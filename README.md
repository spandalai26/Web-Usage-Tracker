# Web-Usage-Tracker
I am trying to build a browser extension to help track web usage.

- The aim is to build something that will allow users to track usage by spcific categories
- Users will have the option to define the categories
- They will be able to edit or delete existing categories
- Enter comma-separated domain names for each category

I am still trying to build this out and am learning JS concepts on the way. So there will be bugs and code that is not optimized.
